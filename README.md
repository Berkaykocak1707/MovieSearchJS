Movie Search Application
This project showcases a movie search application where users can enter the name of a movie, and the application fetches the search results using The Movie Database (TMDB) API. The application dynamically displays movie information, including the title, poster, overview, and a link to the movie page on TMDB.

Features
Enter a movie name in the search input field.
Click the search button or press enter to fetch the search results.
The application makes an asynchronous request to the TMDB API to retrieve the relevant movie data.
The fetched movie data is displayed as a card, including the movie’s title, poster, and a brief overview.
If no results are found, an alert message is displayed.
Each card includes a link to the movie’s page on TMDB for more information.
